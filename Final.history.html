  <h1> The History of Bonsai </h1>
    <div class="p1">
      <p> The origin of Bonsai traces its roots to early China, thousands of years ago even
          though the word "Bonsai" is of Japanese origin. The Chinese used a method entitled
          "pun-sai" to grow dwarf trees within the confinement of smaller pots. Bonsai 
          was considered a hobby of only the noble within the early days of China, but 
          the Japanese began to incorporate Bonsai with their society as a way to promote
          and influence forms of Zen Buddhism. </p>

      <p> The practice of Bonsai is still fairly new to Western culture and society and it
          it is not as prominently found. English observation of dwarven trees were first
          recognized and recorded in 1637. It would not be until 1940, when Europe would 
          launch its first English Bonsai book. The 19th Century saw the rise of Bonsai
          in The United States, as popular films such as The Karate Kid spurred an interest
          for American Society to investigate further the art of Bonsai. </p>
