  <h1> Care and Maintenance </h1>
    <div class="p1">
      <p> The care and attentiveness for Bonsai trees is much different than that of other
          household plants. Various Bonsai species will need its own respective soil. Soils
          contain many different mineral mixtures, so purchasing the proper kind for your
          Bonsai is important to its growth. Repotting every two years and replenishing the
          Bonsai with fresh soil will keep your Bonsai happy and content.</p>

      <p> Watering the Bonsai tree must be executed with care as well. Each species demands
          various watering routines. Some species may wane due to over-watering, others
          may begin to show signs of weakness if too little water is given. Root rot is a 
          common disease which a Bonsai tree may obtain if watered too much. The extended
          period of moisture and saturation will make the roots soggy and oxygen will be 
          hard to obtain which could end in devastating results. Watering must be precise
          so again, be sure to do your homework!</p>
